    <p style="padding:0.9%">Hawking was born in Oxford, into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics</p>

    <ul>
        <li>    "Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing? " 
          <li>  "All of my life, I have been fascinated by the big questions that face us, and have tried to find scientific answers to them. If, like me, you have looked at the stars, and tried to make sense of what you see, you too have started to wonder what makes the universe exist." </li>
           <li> "Science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be spontaneously created out of nothing. It is a matter of chance which we are in." </li>
        <li> "The whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner, but that they reflect a certain underlying order, which may or may not be divinely inspired. " </li>
    <li> "We should seek the greatest value of our action." </li>
<li>   "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." </li>
<li>       "It is not clear that intelligence has any long-term survival value. " </li>
<li>       "One cannot really argue with a mathematical theorem." </li>
<li>       "It is a waste of time to be angry about my disability. One has to get on with life and I haven't done badly. People won't have time for you if you are always angry or complaining." </li>
<li>       "I relish the rare opportunity I've been given to live the life of the mind. But I know I need my body and that it will not last forever."</li>

        <p style="font-size:140%">"Cambridge (/ˈkeɪmbrɪdʒ/[2] KAYM-brij) is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom, on the River Cam approximately 55 miles (89 km) north of London. At the United Kingdom Census 2011, the population of the Cambridge built-up area (which is larger than the remit of Cambridge City Council) was 158,434 including 29,327 students.[3] Cambridge became an important trading centre during the Roman and Viking ages, and there is archaeological evidence of settlement in the area as early as the Bronze Age. The first town charters were granted in the 12th century, although modern city status was not officially conferred until 1951. "</p>
        <i>Hawking was also a supporter of a universal basic income.[384] He was critical of the Israeli government's position on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, stating that their policy "is likely to lead to disaster."[385]</i>
